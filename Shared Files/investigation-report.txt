This is a private diary of Karl. I'm the head of security at Durhamazon. I generally spend my time reviewing the CCTV footage and reading books, especially Tolkien. I've been investigating "Jess" recently, ever since I saw her acting suspiciously near Alice's desk, then leave a note. I found her original identification card, and her real name is "Charlotte Rebeled". Why would she create a fake ID and call herself "Jess" instead? I need to investigate this more.
